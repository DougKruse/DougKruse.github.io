### Smash Arena
So my friends and I often play games in garry's mod, most notably TTT. However I was interesed in a game that I couldn't quite find, one that allows the fun pacing of games like quake and other arena based shooters with the accessability of a game like Super Smash Bros. Seemed like a natural fit to transfer the "Knock enemies to their death" free for all style to a FPS setting. 

So starting with that I set about thinking what type of weapons and I eventually settled on four: a bat that knocks enemies flying away, a shotgun that fires physics-enabled skins, a harpoon launcher, and a charging hitscan laser that sends enemies flying based on their vector differance from the shooter. The main focus of all the guns is not damage, but instead the knockback that they apply in unique ways. Not a lot of a work, but a fun simple project to play with friends.
